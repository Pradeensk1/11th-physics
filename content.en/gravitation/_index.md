We are amazed looking at the glittering sky; we wonder how the Sun rises in the East and sets in the West, why there are comets or why stars twinkle. The sky has been an object of curiosity for human beings from time immemorial. We have always wondered about the motion of stars, the Moon, and the planets. From Aristotle to Stephen Hawking, great minds have tried to understand the movement of celestial objects in space and what causes their motion.

The ‘Theory of Gravitation’ was developed by Newton in the late 17th century to explain the motion of celestial

objects and terrestrial objects and answer most of the queries raised. In spite of the study of gravitation and its effect on celestial objects, spanning last three centuries, “gravitation” is still one of the active areas of research in physics today. In 2017, the Nobel Prize in Physics was given for the detection of ‘Gravitational waves’ which was theoretically predicted by Albert Einstein in the year 1915. Understanding planetary motion, the formation of stars and galaxies, and recently massive objects like black holes and their life cycle have remained the focus of study for the past few centuries in physics.

**Geocentric Model of Solar System** In the second century, Claudius Ptolemy, a famous Greco-Roman astronomer,

_n all of astronomy is that the stars are made up ind as those in the Earth”_ – Richard Feynman




  

developed a theory to explain the motion of celestial objects like the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Jupiter etc. This theory was called the geocentric model. According to the geocentric model, the Earth is at the center of the universe and all celestial objects including the Sun, the Moon, and other planets orbit the Earth. Ptolemy’s model closely matched with the observations of the sky with our naked eye. But later, astronomers found that even though Ptolemy’s model successfully explained the motion of the Sun and the Moon up to a certain level, the motion of Mars and Jupiter could not be explained effectively.

**Heliocentric Model of Nicholas Copernicus** In the 15th century, a Polish astronomer, Nicholas Copernicus (1473-1543) proposed a new model called the ‘Heliocentric model’ in which the Sun was considered to be at the center of the solar system and all planets including the Earth orbited the Sun in circular orbits. This model successfully explained the motion of all celestial objects.

Around the same time, Galileo, a famous Italian physicist discovered that all objects close to Earth were accelerated towards the Earth at the same rate. Meanwhile, a noble man called Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) spent his entire lifetime in recording the observations of the stellar and planetary positions with his naked eye. The data that he compiled were analyzed later by his assistant Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) and eventually the analysis led to the deduction of the laws of the planetary motion. These laws are termed as ‘Kepler’s laws of planetary motion’.  

## Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion


Kepler’s laws are stated as follows:

1\. **Law of orbits:** Each planet moves around the Sun in an

elliptical orbit with the Sun at one of the foci.

The closest point of approach of the planet to the Sun ‘P’ is called perihelion and the farthest point ‘A’ is called aphelion (Figure 6.1). The semi-major axis is ‘a’ and semi-minor axis is ‘b’. In fact, both Copernicus and Ptolemy considered planetary orbits to be circular, but Kepler discovered that the actual orbits of the planets are elliptical.

2\. **Law of area:**

The radial vector (line joining the Sun to a planet) sweeps equal areas in equal intervals of time.

In Figure 6.2, the white shaded portion is the area DA swept in a small interval of time Dt, by a planet around the Sun. Since the Sun is not at the center of the ellipse**_,_** _the planets travel faster when they are nearer to the Sun and slower when they are farther from it, to cover equal area in equal intervals of time._ Kepler discovered the law of area by carefully noting the variation in the speed of planets.

3\. **Law of period:**

The square of the time period of revolution of a planet around the Sun in its elliptical orbit is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the ellipse. It can be written as:

<!-- _T a_2 3∝ (6.1)

_T a_

T^2 is proportional to a^3   (6.1)

where, T is the time period of revolution for a planet and _a_ is the semi-major axis. Physically this law implies that as the distance of the planet from the Sun increases, the time period also increases but not at the same rate.

## Universal Law of Gravitation


Even though Kepler’s laws were able to explain the planetary motion, they failed to explain the forces responsible for it. It was Isaac Newton who analyzed Kepler’s laws, Galileo’s observations and deduced the law of gravitation.

Newton’s law of gravitation states that a particle of mass _M_1 attracts any other particle of mass _M_2 in the universe with an attractive force. The strength of this force of attraction was found to be directly proportional to the product of their masses and is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. In mathematical form, it can be written as:



_F GM M_

_r r_\=− 1 2

2 ̆ (6.3)  

where _r_ is the unit vector from _M_1 towards _M_2 as shown in Figure 6.3, and G is the Gravitational constant that has the value of 6 67 10 11 2 2. × − −_N m kg_ , and _r_ is the distance between the two masses _M_1 and _M_2\. In Figure 6.3, the vector



_F_ denotes the gravitational force experienced by _M_2 due to _M_1\. Here the negative sign indicates that the gravitational force is always attractive in nature and the direction of the force is along the line joining the two masses.

It is to be noted that this force is very small. This is the reason we do not feel the gravitational force of attraction between each other. The small value of G plays a very crucial role in deciding the strength of the force.

The force of attraction ( 

_F_21) experienced by the mass m2 due to m1 is in the negative ‘y’ direction ie., _r j_\=− . According to Newton’s third law, the mass m2 also exerts equal and opposite force on m1. So the force of attraction (



_F_12) experienced by m1 due to m2 is in the direction of positive ‘y’ axis ie., _r j_\= .

**Important features of gravitational force:** „ As the distance between two masses

increases, the strength of the force tends to decrease because of inverse dependence on _r_2\. Physically it implies that the planet Uranus experiences less gravitational force from the Sun than the Earth since Uranus is at larger distance from the Sun compared to the Earth.

„ The gravitational forces between two particles always constitute an action- reaction pair. It implies that the gravitational force exerted by the Sun on the Earth is always towards the Sun. The reaction-force is exerted by the Earth on the Sun. The direction of this reaction force is towards Earth.

momentum 

_L_ is a constant vector. The angular momentum of the Earth about the Sun is constant throughout the motion. It is true for all the planets. In fact, this constancy of angular momentum leads to the Kepler’s second law.

„ The expression 

_F GM M r_

_r_\=− 1 2 2

̆ has one

inherent assumption that both _M_1 and

_M_2 are treated as point masses. When it is said that Earth orbits around the Sun due to Sun’s gravitational force, we assumed Earth and Sun to be point masses. This assumption is a good approximation because the distance between the two bodies is very much larger than their diameters. For some irregular and extended objects separated by a small distance, we cannot directly use the equation (6.3). Instead, we have to invoke separate mathematical treatment which will be brought forth in higher classes.

„ However, this assumption about point masses holds even for small distance for one special case. To calculate force of attraction between a hollow sphere of mass M with uniform density and point mass m kept outside the hollow sphere, we can replace the hollow sphere of mass M as equivalent to a point mass M located at the center of the hollow sphere. The force of attraction between the hollow sphere of mass M and point mass m can be calculated by treating the  

hollow sphere also as another point mass. Essentially the entire mass of the hollow sphere appears to be concentrated at the center of the hollow sphere. It is shown in the Figure 6.5(a).

„ There is also another interesting result. Consider a hollow sphere of mass M. If we place another object of mass ‘m’ inside this hollow sphere as in Figure 6.5(b), the force experienced by this mass ‘m’ will be zero. This calculation will be dealt with in higher classes.

„ The triumph of the law of gravitation is that it concludes that the mango that is falling down and the Moon orbiting the Earth are due to the same gravitational force.

 (6.10)

Here negative sign implies that the force is attractive and it acts towards the center. In equation (6.10), mass of the planet ‘m’ comes explicitly. But Newton strongly felt that according to his third law, if Earth is attracted by the Sun, then the Sun must also be attracted by the Earth with the same magnitude of force. So he felt that the Sun’s mass (M) should also occur explicitly in the expression for force (6.10). From this insight, he equated the constant 4 2π _k to GM_ which turned out to be the law of gravitation.

_F GMm r_

  2

Again the negative sign in the above equation implies that the gravitational force is attractive.

In the above discussion we assumed that the orbit of the planet to be circular which is not true as the orbit of the planet around the Sun is elliptical. But this circular orbit assumption is justifiable because planet’s orbit is very close to being circular and there is only a very small deviation from the circular shape.

The above calculation depends on knowing the distance between the Earth and the

Moon and the radius of the Earth. The radius of the Earth was measured by Greek librarian Eratosthenes and distance between the Earth and the Moon was measured by Greek astronomer Hipparchrus 2400 years ago. It is very interesting to note that in order to measure these distances he used only high school geometry and trigonometry. These details are discussed in the astronomy section (6.5).

**Note**

## Gravitational Constant


In the law of gravitation, the value of gravitational constant G plays a very important role. The value of G explains why the gravitational force between the Earth and the Sun is so great while the same force between two small objects (for example between two human beings) is negligible.

From this it is clear that the force can be calculated simply by knowing the value of g. It is to be noted that in the above calculation G is not required.

In the year 1798, Henry Cavendish experimentally determined the value of

gravitational constant ‘G’ by using a torsion balance. He calculated the value of ‘G’ to be equal to 6.75 × − −10 11 2N m kg2 . Using modern techniques a more accurate value of G could be measured. The currently accepted value of G is 6.67259 × − −10 11 2N m kg2 .




  

# GRAVITATIONAL FIELD AND GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL


## Gravitational field


Force is basically due to the interaction between two particles. Depending upon the type of interaction we can have two kinds of forces: Contact forces and Non-contact forces (Figure 6.8).

**Planet**

**Sun**

**Figure 6.8** Depiction of contact and non-contact forces

Contact forces are the forces applied where one object is in physical contact with the other. The movement of the object is caused by the physical force exerted through the contact between the object and the agent which exerts force.

Consider the case of Earth orbiting around the Sun. Though the Sun and the  

Earth are not physically in contact with each other, there exists an interaction between them. This is because of the fact that the Earth experiences the gravitational force of the Sun. This gravitational force is a non- contact force.

It sounds mysterious that the Sun attracts the Earth despite being very far from it and without touching it. For contact forces like push or pull, we can calculate the strength of the force since we can feel or see. But how do we calculate the strength of non-contact force at different distances? To understand and calculate the strength of non-contact forces, the concept of ‘field’ is introduced.

The gravitational force on a particle of mass ‘m2’ due to a particle of mass ‘m1’ is



_F Gm m r_

_r_21 1 2 2=− (6.14)

where is a unit vector that points from _m_1 to _m_2 along the line joining the masses _m_1 and _m_2.

The gravitational field intensity 

_E_1 (here after called as gravitational field) at a point which is at a distance r from m1 is defined as the gravitational force experienced by unit mass placed at that point. It is given by the

ratio 

_F m_

21

2

(where _m_2 is the mass of the object

on which 

_F_21 acts)

Using 



_E F m_1

21

2

\= in equation (6.14) we get,



_E Gm r_

_r_1 1

2=− (6.15)




  



_E_1 is a vector quantity that points towards the mass _m_1 and is independent of mass _m_2, Here _m2 is taken to be of unit magnitude . The unit_ is along the line between _m_1 and the point in

question. The field 

_E_1 is due to the mass _m_1\. In general, the gravitational field intensity

due to a mass M at a distance r is given by



_E GM r_

_r_\=− 2 (6.16)

Now in the region of this gravitational field, a mass ‘m’ is placed at a point P (Figure 6.9). Mass ‘m’ interacts with the field



_E_ and experiences an attractive force due to M as shown in Figure 6.9. The gravitational force experienced by ‘m’ due to ‘M’ is given by

**r F = m E**

**Figure 6.9** Gravitational Field intensity measured with an object of unit mass

Now we can equate this with Newton’s second law



_F ma_\=

_ma mE_



\= (6.18)





_a E_\= (6.19)

In other words, equation (6.18) implies that the gravitational field at a point is equivalent to the acceleration experienced  

by a particle at that point. However, it is to be noted that _a_ and



_E_ are separate physical quantities that have the same magnitude and direction. The gravitational field



_E_ is the property of the source and acceleration a is the effect experienced by the test mass (unit mass) which is placed in the gravitational field



_E_ . The non- contact interaction between two masses can now be explained using the concept of “Gravitational field”.

**Points to be noted:**

i) The strength of the gravitational field decreases as we move away from the mass M as depicted in the Figure 6.10. The magnitude of



_E_ decreases as the distance r increases.

**Figure 6.10** Strength of the Gravitational field lines decreases with distance

**R Q**

**P**

Figure 6.10 shows that the strength of the gravitational field at points P, Q, and R is given by

  

_E E EP Q R_< < . It can be understood by comparing the length of the vectors at points P, Q, and R.

ii) The “field” concept was introduced as a mathematical tool to calculate gravitational interaction. Later it was found that field is a real physical quantity and it carries energy and momentum in




  

space. The concept of field is inevitable in understanding the behavior of charges.

iii) The unit of gravitational field is Newton per kilogram (N/kg) or m s-2.

## Superposition principle for Gravitational field


Consider ‘n’ particles of masses _m m mn_1 2, , . , distributed in space at positions   …_r r r_1 2 3, , etc, with respect to point P. The total gravitational field at a point P due to all the masses is given by the vector sum of the gravitational field due to the individual masses (Figure 6.11). This principle is known as superposition of gravitational fields.

The concept of potential energy and its physical meaning were dealt in unit 4. The gravitational force is a conservative force and hence we can define a gravitational potential energy associated with this conservative force field.

Two masses m1 and m2 are initially separated by a distance ′_r_ . Assuming m1 to be fixed in its position, work must be done on m2 to move the distance from ′_r_ to _r_ as shown in Figure 6.12(a)

To move the mass m2 through an infinitesimal displacement _dr_ from   _r to r dr_ + (shown in the Figure 6.12(b)), work has to be done externally. This infinitesimal work is given by

This work done W gives the gravitational potential energy difference of the system of masses m1 and m2 when the separation between them are _r_ and ′_r_ respectively.

**Case 1: If _r r_**  Since gravitational force is attractive, m2 is attracted by m1.Then m2 can move from ′_r_ to _r_ without any external work (Figure 6.13(a)). Here work is done by the system spending its internal energy and hence the work done is said to be negative.

**Case 2: If** _r r_\> ′ Work has to be done against gravity to move the object from ′_r_ to r (Figure 6.13(b)). Therefore work is done on the body by external force and hence work done is positive.

It is to be noted that only potential energy difference has physical significance. Now gravitational potential energy can be discussed by choosing one point as the reference point.

Let us choose   _r_ . Then the second term in the equation (6.28) becomes zero.

_W Gm m r_

  1 2 0 (6.29)

Now we can define gravitational potential energy of a system of two masses m1 and m2 separated by a distance r as the amount of work done to take the mass m2

from a distance r to infinity assuming m1 to be fixed in its position and is written

as _U r Gm m r_

    1 2 . It is to be noted that

the gravitational potential energy of the system consisting of two masses m1 and m2 separated by a distance r, is the gravitational potential energy difference of the system when the masses are




  

separated by an infinite distance and by distance r. _U r U r U_       . Here we choose _U_   = 0 as the reference point. The gravitational potential energy U _r_  is always negative because when two masses come together slowly from infinity, work is done by the system.

The unit of gravitational potential energy _U r_  is Joule and it is a scalar quantity. The gravitational potential energy depends upon the two masses and the distance between them.

## Gravitational potential energy near the surface of the Earth


It is already discussed in chapter 4 that when an object of mass m is raised to a height h, the potential energy stored in the object is mgh (Figure 6.14). This can be derived using the general expression for gravitational potential energy.

We know that, for a mass m on the Earth’s surface,

_G M m R_

_mgRe_

_e e_\= (6.34)

Substituting equation (6.34) in (6.33) we get,

_U mgR mghe_   (6.35)

It is clear that the first term in the above expression is independent of the height h. For example, if the object is taken from




  

height h1 to h2,then the potential energy at h1 is

_U h mgR mghe_1 1     (6.36)

and the potential energy at h2 is

_U h mgR mghe_2 2     (6.37)

The potential energy difference between h1 and h2 is

_U h U h mg h h_2 1 2 1( ) − ( ) = −( ). (6.38)

The term mgRe in equations (6.36) and (6.37) plays no role in the result. Hence in the equation (6.35) the first term can be omitted or taken to zero. Thus it can be stated that The gravitational potential energy stored in the particle of mass m at a height h from the surface of the Earth is _U mgh_\= . On the surface of the Earth, _U_ \= 0, since h is zero.

It is to be noted that mgh is the work done on the particle when we take the mass m from the surface of the Earth to a height h. This work done is stored as a gravitational potential energy in the mass m. Even though mgh is gravitational potential energy of the system (Earth and mass m), we can take mgh as the gravitational potential energy of the mass m since Earth is stationary when the mass moves to height h.

## Gravitational potential V(r)


It is explained in the previous sections that the gravitational field



_E_ depends only on the source mass which creates the field. It is a vector quantity. We can also define a scalar quantity called “gravitational potential” which depends only on the source mass.  

The gravitational potential at a distance r due to a mass is defined as the amount of work required to take unit mass from the distance r to infinity and it is denoted as V(r). In other words, the gravitational potential at distance r is equivalent to gravitational potential energy per unit mass at the same distance r. It is a scalar quantity and its unit is J kg-1

We can determine gravitational potential from gravitational potential energy. Consider two masses m1 and m2 separated by a distance r which has gravitational potential energy _U r_  (Figure 6.15). The gravitational potential due to mass m1 at a point P which is at a distance r from m1 is obtained by making m2 equal to unity (m2 = 1kg). Thus the gravitational potential V _r_  due to mass _m_1 at a distance r is

_V r Gm r_

**Figure 6.15** Point mass placed at a distance

Gravitational field and gravitational force are vector quantities whereas the gravitational potential and gravitational potential energy are scalar quantities. The motion of particles can be easily analyzed using scalar quantities than vector quantities. Consider the example of a falling apple:

Figure 6.16 shows an apple which falls on Earth due to Earth’s gravitational force. This can be explained using the concept of gravitational potential _V r_  as follows.

(6.40)

The gravitational potential V _r_  on the surface of Earth is given by,

_V r R GM R_

_e_    (6.41)

Thus we see that

_V r R V r R h_\=( ) < = +( ) . (6.42)

It is already discussed in the previous section that the gravitational potential energy near the surface of the Earth at height _h_ is _mgh_. The gravitational potential at this point is simply _V h U h m_    / = _gh_. In fact, the gravitational potential on the surface of the Earth is zero since _h_ is zero. So the apple falls from a region of a higher gravitational potential to a region of lower gravitational potential. In general, the mass will move from a region of higher gravitational potential to a region of lower gravitational potential.  

**EXAMPLE 6.5**

Water falls from the top of a hill to the ground. Why?

This is because the top of the hill is a point of higher gravitational potential than the surface of the Earth i.e._V Vhill ground_\>

Water falling from hill top

The motion of particles can be analyzed more easily using scalars like _U r or V r_   

than vector quantities like _F or E_  

. In modern theories of physics, the concept of potential plays a vital role.

# ACCELERATION DUE TO GRAVITY OF THE EARTH


When objects fall on the Earth, the acceleration of the object is towards the Earth. From Newton’s second law, an object is accelerated only under the action of a force. In the case of Earth, this force is the gravitational pull of Earth. This force produces a constant acceleration near the Earth’s surface in all bodies, irrespective of their masses. The gravitational force exerted by Earth on the mass m near the surface of the Earth is given by

\= 2 . (6.44)

It is to be noted that the acceleration experienced by any object is independent of its mass. The value of g depends only on the mass and radius of the Earth. Infact, Galileo arrived at the same conclusion 400 years ago that _all objects fall towards the Earth with the same acceleration_ through various quantitative experiments. The acceleration due to gravity g is found to be 9.8 m s−2 on the surface of the Earth near the equator.

Here also ′ <_g g_ . As depth increases, ′_g_ decreases. It is very interesting to know that acceleration due to gravity is maximum on the surface of the Earth but decreases when we go either upward or downward.  

**Variation of g with latitude:** Whenever we analyze the motion of objects in rotating frames \[explained in chapter 3\] we must take into account the centrifugal force. Even though we treat the Earth as an inertial frame, it is not exactly correct because the Earth spins about its own axis. So when an object is on the surface of the Earth, it experiences a centrifugal force that depends on the latitude of the object on Earth. If the Earth were not spinning, the force on the object would have been _mg_ . However, the object experiences an additional centrifugal force due to spinning of the Earth.

# ESCAPE SPEED AND ORBITAL SPEED


Hydrogen and helium are the most abundant elements in the universe but Earth’s atmosphere consists mainly of nitrogen and oxygen. The following discussion brings forth the reason why hydrogen and helium are not found in abundance on the Earth’s atmosphere. When an object is thrown up with some initial speed it will reach a certain height after which it will fall back to Earth. If the same object is thrown again with a higher speed, it reaches a greater height than the previous one and falls back to Earth. This leads to the question of what should be the speed of an object thrown vertically up such that it escapes the Earth’s gravity and would never come back. This speed is called “Escape speed” and it is defined as “the minimum speed required for a body to escape from the earth’s gravitational pull”.

Consider an object of mass M on the surface of the Earth. When it is thrown up with an initial speed _vi_, the initial total energy of the object is

When the object reaches a height far away from Earth and hence treated as approaching infinity, the gravitational potential energy becomes zero \[_U_    0\] and the kinetic energy becomes zero as well. Therefore the final total energy of the

in which the object is thrown. Irrespective of whether the object is thrown vertically up, radially outwards or tangentially it requires the same initial speed to escape Earth’s gravity. It is shown in Figure 6.19

Earth

**Figure 6.19** Escape speed independent of angle

Lighter molecules such as hydrogen and helium have enough speed to escape from the Earth, unlike the heavier ones such as nitrogen and oxygen. (The average speed of hydrogen and helium atoms compaired with the escape speed of the Earth,is presented in the kinetic theory of gases, unit 9).

## Satellites, orbital speed and time period


We are living in a modern world with sophisticated technological gadgets and are able to communicate to any place on Earth. This advancement was made possible because of our understanding of solar system. Communication mainly depends on the satellites that orbit the Earth (Figure 6.20). Satellites revolve around the Earth just like the planets revolve around the Sun. Kepler’s laws are applicable to man- made satellites also.




  

For a satellite of mass _M_ to move in a circular orbit, centripetal force must be acting on the satellite. This centripetal force is provided by the Earth’s gravitational force.

## Energy of an Orbiting Satellite


The total energy of a satellite orbiting the Earth at a distance h from the surface of Earth is calculated as follows; The total energy of the satellite is the sum of its kinetic energy and the gravitational potential energy. The potential energy of the satellite is,

The negative sign in the total energy implies that the satellite is bound to the Earth and it cannot escape from the Earth.

As _h_ approaches ¥ , the total energy tends to zero. Its physical meaning is that the satellite is completely free from the influence of Earth’s gravity and is not bound to Earth at large distances.

## Geo-stationary and polar satellite


The satellites orbiting the Earth have different time periods corresponding to different orbital radii. Can we calculate the orbital radius of a satellite if its time period is 24 hours?

Substituting for the time period (24 hrs = 86400 seconds), mass, and radius of the Earth, _h_ turns out to be 36,000 km. Such satellites are called “geo-stationary satellites”, since they appear to be stationary when seen from Earth.

India uses the INSAT group of satellites that are basically geo-stationary satellites for the purpose of telecommunication. Another type of satellite which is placed at a distance

of 500 to 800 km from the surface of the Earth orbits the Earth from north to south direction. This type of satellite that orbits Earth from North Pole to South Pole is called a polar satellite. The time period of a polar satellite is nearly 100 minutes and the satellite completes many revolutions in a day. A Polar satellite covers a small strip of area from pole to pole during one revolution. In the next revolution it covers a different strip of area since the Earth would have moved by a small angle. In this way polar satellites cover the entire surface area of the Earth.

## Weightlessness


**Weight of an object**

Objects on Earth experience the gravitational force of Earth. The gravitational force acting on an object of mass m is mg. This force always acts downwards towards the center of the Earth. When we stand on the floor, there are two forces acting on us. One is the gravitational force, acting downwards and the other is the normal force exerted by the floor upwards on us to keep us at rest. The weight of an object W

 is defined

as the downward force whose magnitude W is equal to that of upward force that must be applied to the object to hold it at rest or at constant velocity relative to the earth. The direction of weight is in the direction of gravitational force. So the magnitude of

weight of an object is denoted as, W=N=mg. Note that even though magnitude of weight is equal to mg, it is not same as gravitational force acting on the object.

**Apparent weight in elevators**

Everyone who used an elevator would have felt a jerk when the elevator takes off or stops. Why does it happen? Understanding the concept of weight is crucial for explaining this effect. Let us consider a man inside an elevator in the following scenarios.

When a man is standing in the elevator, there are two forces acting on him.

1\. Gravitational force which acts downward. If we take the vertical direction as positive y direction, the gravitational force acting on the man is 

_F mgjG_ \=− 2. The normal force exerted by floor on

the man which acts vertically upward, 

_N Nj_\=

**Case (i) When the elevator is at rest**

The acceleration of the man is zero. Therefore the net force acting on the man is zero. With respect to inertial frame (ground), applying Newton’s second law on the man,

 

_F N mgj Nj_

_G_ \+ = − + =

0 0

By comparing the components, we can write

N – mg = 0 (or) N = mg (6.67)

Since weight, W =N, the apparent weight of the man is equal to his actual weight. **Case (ii) When the elevator is moving uniformly in the upward or downward direction** In uniform motion (constant velocity), the net force acting on the man is still zero.  

Hence, in this case also the apparent weight of the man is equal to his actual weight. It is shown in Figure 6.23(a)

**Case (iii) When the elevator is accelerating upwards** If an elevator is moving with upward acceleration ( )_a aj_\= with respect to inertial frame (ground), applying Newton’s second law on the man,

 

_F N maG_ \+ =

Writing the above equation in terms of unit vector in the vertical direction,

− + =_mgj Nj maj_

By comparing the components,

_N_ = _m_ (_g_ + _a_ ) (6.68)

Therefore, apparent weight of the man is greater than his actual weight. It is shown in Figure 6.23(b)

**Case (iv) When the elevator is accelerating downwards** If the elevator is moving with downward acceleration ( _a aj_\=− ˆ), by applying Newton’s second law on the man, we can write

 

_F N maG_  

Writing the above equation in terms of unit vector in the vertical direction,

− + =−_mgj Nj maj_

By comparing the components,

N = m (g − a ) (6.69)




  

Therefore, apparent weight W = N = m(g-a) of the man is lesser than his actual weight. It is shown in Figure 6.23(c)

**Weightlessness of freely falling bodies**

Freely falling objects experience only gravitational force. As they fall freely, they are not in contact with any surface (by neglecting air friction). The normal force acting on the object is zero. The downward acceleration is equal to the acceleration due to the gravity of the Earth. i.e (a = g). From equation (6.69) we get.

_a_ = _g_ ∴ _N_ = _m_ (_g_ – _g_) = 0.

This is called the state of weightlessness. When the lift falls (when the lift wire cuts) with downward acceleration a = g, the person inside the elevator is in the state of weightlessness or free fall. It is shown in Figure 6.23(d)

_a_

_v_

_N = mg_

_N = m(g–a)_

Apparent Weight < Actual Weight  

_When the apple was falling from the tree it was weightless.As soon as it hit Newton’s head, it gained weight! and Newton gained physics!_

**_Weightlessness in satellites_**_:_ There is a wrong notion that the astronauts in satellites experience no gravitational force because they are far away from the Earth. Actually the Earth satellites that orbit very close to Earth experience only gravitational force. The astronauts inside the satellite also experience the same gravitational force. Because of this, they cannot exert any force on the floor of the satellite. Thus, the floor of the satellite also cannot exert any normal force on the astronaut. Therefore, the astronauts inside a satellite are in the state of weightlessness. Not only the astronauts, but all the objects in the satellite will be in the state of weightlessness which is similar to that of a free fall. It is shown in the Figure 6.24.

**ELEMENTARY IDEAS OF ASTRONOMY**

Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences in the history of mankind. In the olden days, astronomy was an inseparable part of physical science. It contributed a lot to the development of physics in the 16th century. In fact Kepler’s laws and Newton’s theory of gravitation were formulated and verified using astronomical observations and data accumulated over the centuries by famous astronomers like Hippachrus, Aristachrus, Ptolemy, Copernicus and Tycho Brahe. Without Tycho Brahe’s astronomical observations, Kepler’s laws would not have emerged. Without Kepler’s laws, Newton’s theory of gravitation would not have been formulated.

It was mentioned in the beginning of this chapter that Ptolemy’s geocentric model was replaced by Copernicus’ heliocentric model. It is important to analyze and explain the  

shortcoming of the geocentric model over heliocentric model.

## Heliocentric system over geocentric system


When the motion of the planets are observed in the night sky by naked eyes over a period of a few months, it can be seen that the planets move eastwards and reverse their motion for a while and return to eastward motion again. This is called “retrograde motion” of planets.

Figure 6.25 shows the retrograde motion of the planet Mars. Careful observation for a period of a year clearly shows that Mars initially moves eastwards (February to June), then reverses its path and moves backwards (July, August, September). It changes its direction of motion once again and continues its forward motion (October onwards). In olden days, astronomers recorded the retrograde motion of all

visible planets and tried to explain the motion. According to Aristotle, the other planets and the Sun move around the Earth in the circular orbits. If it was really a circular orbit it was not known how the planet could reverse its motion for a brief interval. To explain this retrograde motion, Ptolemy introduced the concept of “epicycle” in his geocentric model. According to this theory, while the planet orbited the Earth, it also underwent another circular motion termed as “epicycle”. A combination of epicycle and circular motion around the Earth gave rise to retrograde motion of the planets with respect to Earth (Figure 6.26). Essentially Ptolemy retained the Earth centric idea of Aristotle and added the epicycle motion to it.

But Ptolemy’s model became more and more complex as every planet was found to undergo retrograde motion. In the 15th century, the Polish astronomer Copernicus proposed the heliocentric model to explain this problem in a simpler manner. According to this model, the Sun is at the center of the solar system and all planets orbited the Sun. The retrograde motion of planets with respect to Earth is because of the relative motion of the planet with respect to Earth. The retrograde motion from the heliocentric point of view is shown in Figure 6.27.

Figure 6.27 shows that the Earth orbits around the Sun faster than Mars. Because of the relative motion between Mars and Earth, Mars appears to move backwards from July to October. In the same way the retrograde motion of all other planets was explained successfully by the Copernicus model. It was because of its simplicity, the heliocentric model slowly replaced the geocentric model. Historically, if any natural phenomenon has one or more explanations, the simplest one is usually accepted. Though this was not the only reason to disqualify the geocentric model, a detailed discussion

Students are encouraged to observe the motion of the planet Mars by naked eye and identify its retrograde motion. As mentioned above, to observe the retrograde motion six to seven months are required. So students may start their observation of Mars from the month of June and continue till April next year. Mars is the little bright planet with reddish color. The position of the planet Mars in the sky can be easily taken from ‘Google’.

## Kepler’s Third Law and The Astronomical Distance


When Kepler derived his three laws, he strongly relied on Tycho Brahe’s astronomical observation. In his third law, he formulated the relation between the distance of a planet from the Sun to the time period of revolution of the planet. Astronomers cleverly used geometry and trigonometry to calculate the distance of a planet from the Sun in terms of the distance between Earth and Sun. Here we can see how the distance of Mercury and Venus from the Sun were measured. The Venus and Mercury, being inner planets with respect to Earth, the maximum angular distance they can subtend at a point on Earth with respect to the Sun is 46 degree for Venus and 22.5 degree for Mercury. It is shown in the Figure 6.28

Figure 6.29 shows that when Venus is at maximum elongation (i.e., 46 degree) with respect to Earth, Venus makes 90 degree to Sun. This allows us to find the distance between Venus and Sun. The distance between Earth and Sun is taken as one Astronomical unit (1 AU).

To find the distance of exterior planets like Mars and Jupiter, a slightly different method is used. The distances of planets from the Sun is given in the table below.

brilliant insight. He observed that during noon time of summer solstice the Sun’s rays cast no shadow in the city Syne which was located 500 miles away from Alexandria. At the same day and same time he found that in Alexandria the Sun’s rays made 7.2 degree with local vertical as shown in the Figure 6.30. He realized that this difference of 7.2 degree was due to the curvature of the Earth.

The angle 7.2 degree is equivalent to 1 8

radian. So _q_\= 1 8

rad;

If S is the length of the arc between the cities of Syne and Alexandria, and if R is radius of Earth, then

R = 4000 miles

1 mile is equal to 1.609 km. So, he measured the radius of the Earth to be equal to R = 6436 km, which is amazingly close to the correct value of 6378 km.

The distance of the Moon from Earth was measured by a famous Greek astronomer Hipparchus in the 3rd century BC.  

To measure the radius of the Earth, choose two different places (schools) that are separated by at least 500 km. It is important to note that these two places have to be along the same longitude of the Earth (For example Hosur and Kanyakumari lie along the same longitude of 77.82° E). Take poles of known length (h) and fix them vertically in the ground (it may be in the school playgrounds) at both the places. At exactly noon in both the places the length of the shadow (L) cast by each pole has to be noted down. Draw the picture like in Figure

6.30. By using the equation tan  _L h_

,

the angle in radian can be found at each place. The difference in angle (θ ′) is due to the curvature of the Earth. Now the distance between the two schools can be obtained from ‘Google maps’. Divide the distance with the angle (θ ′ in radians) which will give the radius of the Earth.

## Interesting Astronomical Facts


1\. **Lunar eclipse and measurement of shadow of Earth**

On January 31, 2018 there was a total lunar eclipse which was observed from various places including Tamil Nadu. It is possible to measure the radius of shadow of the Earth at the point where the Moon crosses. Figure 6.31 illustrates this.

When the Moon is inside the umbra shadow, it appears red in color. As soon as the Moon exits from the umbra




  

shadow, it appears in crescent shape. Figure 6.32 is the photograph taken by digital camera during Moon’s exit from the umbra shadow.

**Figure 6.32** Image of the Moon when it exits from umbra shadow

By finding the apparent radii of the Earth’s umbra shadow and the Moon, the ratio of the these radii can be calculated. This is shown in Figures 6.33 and 6.34.

The error will reduce if the pictures taken using a high quality telescope are used. It is to be noted that this calculation is done using very simple mathematics.

Early astronomers proved that Earth is spherical in shape by looking at the shape of the shadow cast by Earth on the Moon during lunar eclipse.

2\. **Why there are no lunar eclipse and solar eclipse every month?**

If the orbits of the Moon and Earth lie on the same plane, during full Moon of every month, we can observe lunar eclipse. If this is so during new Moon we can  

observe solar eclipse. But Moon’s orbit is tilted 5° with respect to Earth’s orbit. Due to this 5° tilt, only during certain periods of the year, the Sun, Earth and Moon align in straight line leading to either lunar eclipse or solar eclipse depending on the alignment. This is shown in Figure 6.35

3\. **Why do we have seasons on Earth?** The common misconception is that

‘Earth revolves around the Sun, so when the Earth is very far away, it is winter and when the Earth is nearer, it is summer’. Actually, the seasons in the Earth arise due to the rotation of Earth around the Sun with 23.5° tilt. This is shown in Figure 6.36

Due to this 23.5° tilt, when the northern part of Earth is farther to the Sun, the southern part is nearer to the Sun. So when it is summer in the northern hemisphere, the southern hemisphere experience winter.

4\. **Star’s apparent motion and spinning of the Earth**

The Earth’s spinning motion can be proved by observing star’s position over a night. Due to Earth’s spinning motion, the stars in sky appear to move in circular motion about the pole star as shown in Figure 6.37

## Recent developments of astronomy and gravitation


Till the 19th century astronomy mainly depended upon either observation with the naked eye or telescopic observation. After the discovery of the electromagnetic spectrum at the end of the 19th century, our understanding of the universe increased enormously. Because of this development in the late 19th century it was found that Newton’s law of gravitation could not explain certain phenomena and showed some discrepancies. Albert Einstein formulated his ‘General theory of relativity’ which was one of the most successful theories of 20th century in the field of gravitation.

In the twentieth century both astronomy and gravitation merged together and have grown in manifold. The birth and death of stars were more clearly understood. Many Indian physicists made very important contributions to the field of astrophysics and gravitation.

Subramanian Chandrasekar formulated the theory of black holes and explained the life of stars. These studies brought him the Nobel prize in the year 1983. Another very notable Indian astrophysicist Meghnad Saha discovered the ionization formula which was useful in classifying stars. This formula is now known as “Saha ionization formula”. In the field of gravitation Amal Kumar Raychaudhuri solved an equation now known as “Raychaudhuri equation” which was a very important contribution. Another notable Indian Astrophysicist Jayant V Narlikar made pioneering contribution in the field of astrophysics and has written interesting books on astronomy and astrophysics. IUCAA (Inter University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics) is one of the important Indian research institutes where active research in astrophysics and gravitation are conducted. The institute was founded by Prof. J.V. Narlikar. Students are encouraged to read more about the recent developments in these fields.
