# Propagation of errors

A number of measured quantities may be involved in the final calculation of an experiment. Different types of instruments might have been used for taking readings. Then we may have to look at the errors in measuring various quantities, collectively.

The error in the final result depends on

(i) The errors in the individual measurements

(ii) On the nature of mathematical operations performed to get the final result. So we should know the rules to combine the errors.

The various possibilities of the propagation or combination of errors in different mathematical operations are discussed below:

**(i) Error in the sum of two quantities** 

Let ∆A and ∆B be the absolute errors in the two quantities A and B respectively. Then,

Measured value of A = A ± ∆A 
Measured value of B = B ± ∆B 
Consider the sum, Z = A + B

(iv) Relative error :∆T 01. 1S =  == 00.  419T 26. 2S = 0.04mT m(v) Percentage er ror in T  = 0.04 × 100% = 4%T (vi) Time p eriod o f sim ple p endulum  =T = (2.62 ± 0.11)s |

| 5.12= 2.624 s5. 2s (Rounded o to 2decimal place) |nd |
  

The error ∆Z in Z is then given by

Z ± ∆Z = (A ± ∆A) + (B ± ∆B)

\= (A + B) ± (∆A + ∆B)

\= Z ± (∆A + ∆B)

(or) ∆Z = ∆A + ∆B (1.3)

The maximum possible error in the sum of two quantities is equal to the sum of the absolute errors in the individual quantities.

**EXAMPLE 1.5**

Two resistances R1 = (100 ± 3) W, R2 = (150 ± 2) W, are connected in series. What is their equivalent resistance?

**_Solution_**

R1 = 100 ± =3 1502W; _R_ ± 2W

Equivalent resistance R = ? Equivalent resistance R = R1 2+ _R_

\= (100 ± +3 150) ( ± 2)

\= (100 + 150) ± (3 + 2)

R = (250 ± 5) W

**(ii) Error in the difference of two quantities**

Let ∆A and ∆B be the absolute errors in the two quantities, A and B, respectively. Then, Measured value of A = A ± ∆A Measured value of B = B ± ∆B Consider the difference, Z = A – B The error ∆Z in Z is then given by Z ± ∆Z = (A ± ∆A) – (B ± ∆B)  

\= (A − B) )± ∆A ± ∆B

\= Z ± ∆A ± ∆B

(or) ∆Z = ∆A + ∆B………………(1.4)

The maximum error in difference of two quantities is equal to the sum of the absolute errors in the individual quantities.

**EXAMPLE 1.6**

The temperatures of two bodies measured by a thermometer are t1 = (20 + 0.5)°C, t2 = (50 ± 0.5)°C. Calculate the temperature difference and the error therein.

**_Solution_**

t1 = (20 ± 0 5. )°C t2 = (50 ± 0 5. )°C

temperature difference t=?

t = t2 - t1 = (50 ± 0 5. ) - (20 ± 0 5. )°C

(Using equation1.4)

\= (50 – 20) ± +( . . )0 5 0 5

t = (30 ± 1)°C

**(iii) Error in the product of two quantities** Let ∆A and ∆B be the absolute errors in the two quantities A, and B, respectively. Consider the product Z = AB The error ∆Z in Z is given by Z ± ∆Z = (A ± ∆A) (B ± ∆B)

\= (AB) ± (A ∆B) ± (B ∆A) ± (∆A . ∆B)

Dividing L.H.S by Z and R.H.S by AB, we get,
