# Application and Limitations of the Method of Dimensional Analysis.


**This method is used to** 

(i) Convert a physical quantity from one system of units to another. 
(ii) Check the dimensional correctness of a given physical equation. 
(iii) Establish relations among various physical quantities.

**(i) To convert a physical quantity from one system of units to another**

This is based on the fact that the product of the numerical values (n) and its corresponding unit (u) is a constant. i.e, n [u] = constant (or) n1[u1] = n2[u2].

Consider a physical quantity which has dimension ‘_a’_ in mass, ‘_b’_ in length and ‘_c’_ in time. If the fundamental units in one system are M1, L1 and T1 and the other system are M2, L2 and T2 respectively, then we can write,

FORMULA

c\] We have thus converted the numerical

value of physical quantity from one system of units into the other system.

**EXAMPLE 1.12**

Convert 76 cm of mercury pressure into Nm−2 using the method of dimensions.

**_Solution_**

In cgs system 76 cm of mercury pressure = 76 × 13.6 × 980 dyne cm−2

The dimensional formula of pressure P is \[ML−1T−2\]

**EXAMPLE 1.13**

If the value of universal gravitational constant in SI is 6.6x10−11 Nm2 kg−2, then find its value in CGS System?

**_Solution_**

Let GSI be the gravitational constant in the SI system and Gcgs in the cgs system. Then

GSI = 6.6 × -10 11Nm2 kg−2

**(ii) To check the dimensional correctness of a given physical equation** Let us take the equation of motion v = u + at Apply dimensional formula on both sides [LT−1] = [LT−1] + [LT−2] [T]  [LT−1] = [LT−1] + [LT−1]

(Quantities of same dimension only can be added)

We see that the dimensions of both sides are same. Hence the equation is dimensionally correct.

**EXAMPLE 1.14**

Check the correctness of the equation 1 2

2_mv mgh_\= using dimensional analysis

method.

**_Solution_**

Dimensional formula for

1 2

2 1 2 2 2_mv_ \= =- -\[M\]\[LT \] \[ML T \]

Dimensional formula for

_mgh_ \= =- -\[M\]\[LT \]\[L\] \[ML T \]2 2 2

\[ML2T−2\] = \[ML2T−2\]

Both sides are dimensionally the

same, hence the equations 1 2

2_mv mgh_\= is dimensionally correct.

**(iii) To establish the relation among various physical quantities** If the physical quantity Q depends upon the quantities Q1, Q2 and Q3 ie. Q is proportional to Q1, Q2 and Q3.

Then,

Q ∝ Q1 a Q2

b Q3 c

Q = k Q1 a Q2

b Q3 c

where k is a dimensionless constant. When the dimensional formula of Q, Q1, Q2 and Q3

are substituted, then according to the principle of homogeneity, the powers of M, L, T are made equal on both sides of the equation. From this, we get the values of a, b, c

**EXAMPLE 1.15**

Obtain an expression for the time period T of a simple pendulum. The time period T depends on (i) mass ‘_m’_ of the bob (ii) length ‘_l’_ of the pendulum and (iii) acceleration due to gravity _g_ at the place where the pendulum is suspended. (Constant k = 2π) i.e **_Solution_**

_T_ ∝ _m_a _l_b _g_c

_T = km_a _l_b _g_c  

Here k is the dimensionless constant. Rewriting the above equation with dimensions

\[T1\] = \[Ma\] \[Lb\] \[LT−2\]c

\[M0L0T1\] = \[Ma Lb+c T−2c\]

Comparing the powers of M, L and T on both sides, a=0, b+c=0, -2c=1

Solving for a,b and c a = 0, b = 1/2, and c = −1/2

From the above equation T = km0 l

1/2 g−1/2

_T k g_

_k g_\=  

 

\=l

l

1 2

Experimentally k = 2π, hence _T g_\= 2π l

**Limitations of Dimensional analysis**

1. This method gives no information about the dimensionless constants in the formula like 1, 2, ……..π, e (Euler number), etc.

2. This method cannot decide whether the given quantity is a vector or a scalar.

3. This method is not suitable to derive relations involving trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic functions.

4. It cannot be applied to an equation involving more than three physical quantities.

5. It can only check on whether a physical relation is dimensionally correct but not the correctness of the relation. For example using

dimensional analysis, s = ut + 1 3
